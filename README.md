I am a media and entertainment technical specialist at Unity Technologies with 20 years of experience in VFX, CG feature, and TV animation. I have worked for a variety of top studios, including Dreamworks Animation, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Disney Feature Animation, MPC, and Industrial Light and Magic, and I’ve worked as a digital artist supervisor on major franchises including Avengers and Transformers.  In my role at Unity, I work with technical decision-makers and influencers at key studios to advance the art and science of visual effects and animation through the use of real-time technology.
